    "In this model, the constant is near zero and not statistially significant, which makes sense. Humidity and Windspeed though have changed signs (both are still statistically significant) and are now both contributing to increasing the apparent temperature. The interacting variable though (also significant) is much larger and decreases the apparent temperature. I'm thinking that this means that on days when there is low humidity and high winds, it feels hotter. On days when there is high humidity and low wind, it feels hotter. But on days when there is high humidity and high wind it feels a bit cooler than the actual temperature. "
