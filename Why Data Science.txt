Why are you taking this course?

After graduating from college with physics and astronomy degrees I've been working in mostly non-analytical roles 
(political organizer, government, and education). Although I've really loved my roles in these fields I've also
had a nagging feeling that I'm not utilizing all of my skills. I'm taking this course to help me get back to 
what I love and am really good at, analytical thinking and problem solving. 

How do you see your life changing by learning data science?

I'm hoping to be a bit more flexible in my ability to work in different industries, in different locations, and
to be able to take what I learn and apply it in different settings. I have budding interests in rock climbing and
sailing, and I would like to be able to live a life where my work enables, instead of hinders, my ability
to pursue my interests. 

Describe your ideal career.

I'm at my best and happiest when I'm supporting a leader or team by providing concrete answers to help make the 
best decision or to solve a problem. I would love a career where I can bring clarity to people I care about
who are all working on a mission I'm deeply invested in.
